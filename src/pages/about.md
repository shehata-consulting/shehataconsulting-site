## Building Reliable AI Infrastructure

I am **Michael Shehata**, a software engineer and the founder of **Shehata Tech Solutions LLC**.

My goal is simple: I help businesses navigate the noise of modern AI to build tools that actually work. I believe that technology should serve your business goals, not the other way around.

### My Philosophy

I approach every project as a partnership. I don't just write code; I try to understand the operational bottlenecks slowing you down.

* **Practical over Hype:** I prefer proven, stable solutions over experimental trends. If a simple automation script solves the problem better than a complex AI model, I will tell you.
* **Security Focused:** I understand that your data is your competitive advantage. I build systems that prioritize privacy and keep your internal knowledge secure.
* **Long-Term Thinking:** I build software designed to be maintained and scaled, not just to look good in a demo.

### Current Focus

I am currently privileged to be working with a key client to architect a custom AI implementation. This work involves:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Helping teams access their internal knowledge instantly.
* **Process Automation:** Connecting disconnected systems to reduce manual data entry.
* **Custom Development:** Tailoring Python and LLM solutions to specific industry needs.

### Why Connect?

If you are looking for a developer who values clear communication as much as clean code, I would love to hear from you. Whether you are ready to build or just have questions about feasibility, I am always happy to share what I know.
